# Super_Heros_ad_transformation
 
The Task
Your task is two-fold:

I. Clean the files and combine them into one final DataFrame.

   This dataframe should have the following columns:
     Hero (Just the name of the Hero)
     Publisher
     Gender
     Eye color
     Race
     Hair color
     Height (numeric)
     Skin color
     Alignment
     Weight (numeric)
  Plus, one-hot-encoded columns for every power that appears in the dataset. E.g.:
     Agility
     Flight
     Superspeed
     etc.
     Hint: There is a space in "100 kg" or "52.5 cm"



II. Use your combined DataFrame to answer the following questions.

Compare the average weight of super powers who have Super Speed to those who do not.
What is the average height of heroes for each publisher?
